### Student
I'm a Computer Science Senior at South Dakota State University with minors in Mathematics and Software Engineering and on the deans list for 4 semesters at the Jerome J Lohr College of Engineering.
I lead the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM club) at SDSU, previously as secretary, CSC tutor, Hackathon Marketing Manager, Vice-President and now as the President.

I have also participated in 2 hackathons, co-organized a hackathon on our campus, and led 3 workshops, including an AI training for staff.

### Worker
With 11 years of work experience including starting and running a small business, building a website [SlidePot.com](https://slidepot.com) with a peak of over 3000 monthly users, working as a research assistant, research R&D intern, marketing student, and CSC100L lab assistant at my university. Currently, i work with the Division of Research on website design, data analytics and visualization, and as an Undergraduate Research Fellow for the Future Innovators of America program under the McComish Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at SDSU.

### Engineer
I have built 6 websites, codesigned 2 embedded systems including a 10bit Processor, created 2 desktop apps, published 11 GPTs and written 50 console programs. My career goal as a software engineer is to develop tools and solutions for human and AI interaction and other systems surrounding the building deployment of artificial intelligence.

### Hooman
Outside classes and work, I love to play and improvise on the banjolele, piano, guitar, and 13 other instruments (i'll like to learn more). I also enjoy cycling, grilling, and cooking recipes invented on the spot (sometimes ends up amazing, sometimes maybe not üòèüòÖ)
