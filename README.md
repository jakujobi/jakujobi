# Hi there👋🏾

### Student
I'm a Computer Science Junior at South Dakota State University with minors in Mathematics and Software Engineering and a 4/5 deans list at the Jerome J Lohr College of Engineering.
I've led 3 student organizations at SDSU including the Association of Computing Machinary (ACM club) as a secretary, CSC tutor, Hackathon Marketing Manager and later as the Vice-President.

I have also participated in 2 hackathons, co-organized a hackathon on our campus, and led 3 workshops, including an AI training for staff.

### Worker
With 10 years of work experience including starting and running a small business, building a website [SlidePot.com](https://slidepot.com) with a peak of over 3000 monthly users, working as a research assistant, research R&D intern, marketing student, and CSC100L lab assistant at my university. Currently, i work with the Division of Research on website design, data analytics and visualization.

### Engineer
I have built 6 websites, codesigned 2 embedded systems including a 10bit Processor, created 2 desktop apps, published 11 GPTs and written 50 console programs. My career goal as a software engineer is to develop solutions for human and AI interaction and other systems surrounding the deployment of artificial intelligence.

### Hooman
Outside classes and work, I love to play the banjolele, piano, guitar, and 12 other instruments (i'll like to learn more). I also cycling, grilling, and cooking recipes invented on the spot (sometimes ends up amazing, sometimes maybe not 😏😅)
